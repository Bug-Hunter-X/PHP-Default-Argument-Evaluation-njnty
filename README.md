This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to default argument evaluation. The `foo` function intends to provide a default value of 2 for the `$b` parameter if it's not explicitly passed. However, when `foo(1, 0)` is called, it unexpectedly returns 1 instead of 3 because the default value is not reevaluated on each call. The solution shows how to avoid this issue by either always providing an explicit value or using a more robust approach.
